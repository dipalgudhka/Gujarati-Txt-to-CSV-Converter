# Gujarati-Txt-to-CSV-Converter
This app takes in a txt file with Gujarati strings and converts it into a CSV file with an optional word count file as well. This was made to ease the work of Dada Bhagwan Foundation while they were searching for Video Tagging topics from their books.

Here is the link to the app: https://dipalgudhka.github.io/Gujarati-Txt-to-CSV-Converter/GujFilter/
